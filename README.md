# Radar Detection System â€“ Arduino Uno Based

This repository contains the code and documentation for an *Arduino Uno-powered radar detection project* designed to detect objects within a defined range using ultrasonic sensing and display the results visually. It is an effective introductory project for exploring distance measurement, servo control, and real-time data visualization.

## Key Features

- *Object Detection:*  
  Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect objects and measure their distance accurately.

- *Rotational Scanning:*  
  A servo motor rotates the sensor to cover a wide detection area, simulating radar functionality.

- *Real-Time Visualization:*  
  Data can be displayed on a serial monitor or visualized using Processing (or similar software) to create a radar-like interface.

- *Customizable Parameters:*  
  Adjustable detection angles, distance thresholds, and scanning speeds.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Uno board  
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)  
- Servo motor (SG90 or MG90S)  
- Breadboard, jumper wires, and power supply  
- (Optional) Computer running Processing IDE for GUI  

## Applications

- Basic robotics navigation systems  
- Proximity detection and obstacle avoidance  
- Educational demonstrations of radar principles  

## Repository Contents

- Complete Arduino code for sensor control and data handling  
- Optional Processing code for radar-style visualization  
- Circuit diagrams for assembly  
- Setup instructions for quick deployment and testing
